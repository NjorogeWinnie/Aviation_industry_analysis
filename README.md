# Aviation_industry_analysis

# Project Overview
This project seeks to explore aviation risks and generate insights for safer aircraft operations.

# Business Understanding
The company is planning to diversify its portfolio by entering the aviation industry through the purchase and operation of airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises. However, aviation carries inherent risks, including accidents and operational failures, that can lead to significant financial losses, regulatory issues, and reputational damage.
To ensure a safe and profitable entry into this new market, the company must evaluate different aircraft types to identify which ones have historically demonstrated the lowest risk profiles. This will allow leadership to make evidence-based decisions on which aircraft to purchase and operate, thereby minimizing risk exposure while maximizing operational efficiency and long-term growth opportunities.

# Problem Statement
The company currently lacks the expertise and data-driven insights needed to assess the safety and risk levels associated with various aircraft. Without a clear understanding of accident patterns, contributing factors, and risk distribution across different aircraft, the company risks making costly investment decisions.

# Dataset
The data used is an aviation dataset sourced from kaggle.

# Experimental Design
1. Defining the Question
2. Data Preparation
